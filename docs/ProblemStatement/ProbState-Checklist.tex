\begin{itemize}
  
\item Uses the provided \texttt{tex} file as a base
  \begin{todolist}
  \item Includes the input for \texttt{Comments}
  \item Includes a title
  \item Revision history included for major revisions
  \item Remove, or comment out, the original contents of the problem statement (like

  \item Writing style
  \item Use the provided \texttt{.gitignore} file
  \item Hard-wrap at 80 characters per line
  \end{todolist}

\item Overall qualities of documentation
  \begin{todolist}
  \item Scope is clear
  \item Document is abstract (for instance, it does not mention the programming
    language (unless this is a true constraint) or the numerical algorithm
    choice (unless the algorithm is the ``what'' rather than the ``how''))
  \item Output of software is unambiguous
  \item Inputs to software are unambiguous
  \item Problem statement points to Drasil, if this is to be a project
    implemented with Drasil
  \item Document is simple (for instance, there is no need for a table of
    contents)
\end{todolist}

\item Problem statement review issue is created correctly
  \begin{todolist}
  \item Issue includes a link the file to be reviewed, or the commit hash where
    the latest version is found
  \item Issue is assigned to \texttt{smiths}
  \item Your user info on GitHub includes your name, since some GitHub ids do
    not clearly show which student in the class is the owner of the id.
\end{todolist}
